Described problem is easy to fix, so there is no need to open an issue, as the user just will go to the CatBoost documentation and set the `MultiClass` label. But my experiments with other programmers showed that some of new users might be really confused by this problem, and this might cause negative first impression in CatBoost user experience - we want to avoid it.\n",
